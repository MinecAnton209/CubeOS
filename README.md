# CubeOS

**CubeOS** is a 64-bit operating system written from scratch in Rust (with elements of Assembly and C). The project is created for learning low-level programming, OS architecture, and hardware interaction.

## Features (CubeCORE v1.0)
*   **Boot:** Multiboot2 via GRUB2.
*   **Architecture:** x86_64, Long Mode.
*   **Memory:** Physical Memory Manager (PMM), Multiboot2 memory map parsing.
*   **Interrupts:** IDT, PIC remapping (IRQ 0-15), PS/2 keyboard support.
*   **Graphics:** VESA Framebuffer support, custom logger to screen and serial port (COM1).
*   **Drivers:** ATA PIO driver for HDD operations.
*   **File System:** Custom FAT32 driver (in development).

## Build Requirements
To build CubeOS from source, you need a Linux environment (preferably Debian/Ubuntu or Arch) and the following set of tools:
*   `rustc` and `cargo` (Nightly toolchain)
*   `nasm`
*   `gcc`
*   `ld.lld` (LLVM linker)
*   `grub-mkrescue` (for creating ISO)
*   `xorriso`, `mtools`, `qemu-system-x86_64`

## Build and Run
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/cubeweb-lab/CubeOS.git
cd CubeOS

# Build the kernel and csh
make all

# Create a bootable ISO
make iso
# OR create/update the HDD image (no root needed)
make hdd

# Run in QEMU
make run        # from the ISO
make run-hdd    # from the HDD image

# Host-side tests
make test
```
